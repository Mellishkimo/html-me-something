                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <div>
                <p>I began playing Magic: The Gathering when I was in 4th grade, but I never took it very seriously. All I did for years and years was play with my closest friends, or teach kids at the summer camp that I attended, and ultimately worked at. 
                    When I was going to enter my senior year at college, I had a conversation with my best friend at the time, Jasper, about how cool it would be to try and make it to the Magic: The Gathering Pro Tour.
                    I figured that after we graduated from college, life would be a lot less certain, and who knows where we would end up geographically or professionally. We both had somewhat easy academic years ahead of us, so we would have plenty of time to play.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    We did heaps of research on the competitive scene and began playing at game stores in Columbia, MO and our hometown of St. Louis, MO. We had no idea how lofty our goals were.
                    We made an unbelievable amount of new friends while playing at the local shops, many of whom remain dear to this day. I met my close friend Matt Mendoza, who was a game store manager at the time, and he took photos at all the events he hosted. Below is 
                    an image he took of a younger, more handsome version of me, from back in 2014!

                <h2>First Grand Prix</h2>
                <div>
                <p>
                    It was late on a Tuesday night during the school year that I gave Jasper a spontaneous phone call.
                    We had been feeling increasingly confident in our playing abilities and were looking for new challenges,
                    so I let him know that I found out with a little Googling that there was going to be a Grand Prix that weekend
                    in Oklahoma City. Grand Prix are the highest level of Magic competition you can play in without needing an invitation. 
                    In my words it was "only about eight hours away," which I somehow convinced Jasper was totally reasonable.
                    On a whim we registered for the tournament online and booked a cheap hotel near the event site. 

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The actual drive
                    was a hell of an adventure: one of my headlights went out, so I was constantly fearful of being pulled over, a tremendous thunderstorm
                    threatened to derail us as we hit the home stretch, an hour outside OKC, and finally, after sprinting into the hotel lobby, totally soaked, 
                    the desk worker failed to find evidence of our online booking for about a half hour, ultimately allowing us to enter our room
                    at 2 AM. Our excitement for the tournament was not dampened, although our clothes were, and we rose early the next morning and
                    headed to the convention center.

                    <br>
                    <br>

                    At the tournament, I suffered a couple quick losses and decided to drop from the event after just the third of fifteen total rounds.
                    Jasper, the much more experienced and skilled of the two of us, actually managed to qualify for the second day of the event,
                    a rarity for first-time Grand Prix participants. I dominated side events for the remainder of the weekend, earning myself an impressive
                    heap of sealed product to take home. Jasper unfortunately had his luck run dry on the second day and failed to earn any cash prizes from the main event.
                    Despite our rollercoaster weekend, we drove home from OKC on top of the world, desperate for another crack at the Grand Prix circuit.
                    Neither of us took any photos that weekend, but here's a picture of us being goofballs in a crib, just to show the tone of our friendship.

                <h2>Reality and a Taste of Success</h2>
                <div>
                <p>
                    Although Jasper and I had been filled with drive and optimism after Grand Prix Oklahoma City, we didn't get any opportunities for premier level Magic
                    the rest of the year. Through our continuous ups and downs in the Columbia Magic scene, we realized just how far we were from ever qualifying for the Pro Tour.
                    We continued to improve as players, but our growth rate simply wasn't sufficient to achieve any of the goals we had set at the beginning of the year. Instead,
                    our attentions turned toward post-graduate life. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Jasper graduated from Mizzou, and I from Truman. Our friendship remained as strong as ever, but we were still unable 
                    to live in the same city, as Jasper moved away to Quincy for his career, and I moved back home to St. Louis to get my bearings. I started spending more time with Matt Mendoza,
                    and began a friendship with a guy named Jon Saucier, who was only in town for the summer thanks to an internship with Monsanto. Jon, Matt, myself, and an array of
                    ever-changing characters played Magic together week after week, but none of us were having successes worth noting. I found out that the state championship was being held 
                    in August, and I would test out my increasing abilities by playing match after match after match against Jon and Matt. 
                    
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    The day of the championship came, and I felt naively confident.
                    I lost the first round against a new friend of mine after making a terrible misplay, and was upset with myself over my inauspicious start. 
                    I forced myself to rein in my focus and committed myself to not making any more mistakes the rest of the day. As luck would have it, I did not lose a single other game that day.
                    I even had the hilarious privilege of playing my pal Jon in the finals. Knowing how bad the matchup was for him thanks to all of our prior testing, Jon jokingly suggested
                    they just hand me the winnings and get it over with. After two quick victories on my part, and a lot of laughter and smiles, I was crowned the 2014 Missouri State Champion.

                <div>
                <p>
                    The very next week after I won the state championship, I was hired as a sales consultant at Plaza Mercedes-Benz in Creve Coeur.
                    Because it was a sales job, I had to work Saturdays, and that meant that I couldn't play in major Magic tournaments. After a little over a year,
                    I left Plaza to go back to graduate school. I was feeling pretty lost in life, and it wasn't until 2016 that my situation felt stable enough to
                    start focusing on Magic again.

                <p>
                    Once I was able to get back on the grind, I came back with a vengeance. I top 8'd a team Grand Prix in Louisville with my friends Eric Lindgren and Matt Oelkers.
                    We defeated a number of high level pros in that event, so I decided to try and become a member of the Pro Players Club. In order to achieve this,
                    I would have to perform well at a number of Grand Prix's throughout the year. I was able to finish highly at my next two Grand Prix, earning more Pro Points for myself.
                    I capped the run off with another state championship win in spring of 2017. Despite my success, I realized that the level of dedication required to be a professional was simply not for me,
                    and I focused on graduate school again for the latter half of 2017.

                    As I continued to bounce around life like a pinball, I realized that the graduate school path was not right for me either.
                    I worked random jobs here and there and focused on Magic again. I had a stretch from January 2018 to April 2018 where I put up a slew of impressive finishes.
                    I top 8'd a Star City Games Open, and had my first matches on camera, streamed for thousands to spectate. After April, I had a stressful move and a number of life changes 
                    that rendered me unable to go to many events. I only went to a couple tournaments in 2019, but finished well in all but two of them. Now that I am enrolled
                    in LaunchCode, I have totally hung up the cards until I complete the class, wanting to give it my full respect and attention.
